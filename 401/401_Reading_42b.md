## Microsoft and the DoD:
<br>


1. Microsoft and the DoD:
<br>
- For this topic I would have to side with the employees. However this stance is based off the assumption that upon being hired by microsoft, the employees were not read in to any programs or clauses that Microsoft states something to the effect that Microsoft does actively work with DoD programs/funding/directives to develop and implements weapons/items of war. Assuming that to be true, then Microsoft should at a minimum create a separate branch or department specifically for this purpose, and then recruite, whether externally or internally to fill that department with employees that are fully aware of how their work products are being distributed and handled. 

2. What are some analytics you think would be important to track in an application?
<br>
- User Engagement such as amount and their active use time
- User Behaviour such as what they visit and engage with
- Feature usage...what content features they are utilizing


## Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?
<br>


1. Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?
<br>
- This topic simply feeds into the fact that the purpose of this is 1. To make money. 2. To continue down the path of creating lazy complacent humans...which make them more dependent on "Tech".....to then make the companies...money. The issue is not about safety. It's about money. The issues are not about who lives and who dies...it is about how much money the company is on the hook for. If a human is too lazy, or not competent enough to drive, then don't drive. Would there be overall less death? Sure why not. People are terrible drivers. But no one will care about the 100 billion-cajillion lives that are saved by any technology, they will uproar over the 5 that are lost. This is proven time and time again with the military. It's not about the 32,000 properly executed missle strikes...it's about the 1 that didn't go well. I'm not saying it's unjustified, just simply stating there is no "win win". And instead of paying Tech to fulfill yet another aspect of a human responsibility, why don't people step up for once this century, figure our where their moral compass is, and actually work at finding a solution that doesn't involved them clicking a button on their phone.
