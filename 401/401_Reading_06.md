## Java OO
<br>

1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?
<br>
- A class contains an object. The object is the thing that can be manipulated by the class and contains the properties and methods for that variable within the class.

2. Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java.
<br>
- It allows you to quickly customize properties and attributes without having to define what that class is every single time. Such as making a class of animals...all of which have 4 legs and fur. But now you can specify to make things unique.... "Dogs, Cats etc" without having to tell the program that they have 4 legs and tails every single time.


## Java Static Keyword
<br>

1. Static methods are also called what? Why?
<br>
- They are also called class methods because they belong to the Class and not the object itself. This means they are separate from the objects state, they do not need an instance to function, and objects within the class can therefore inherit the static methods behavior.

2. How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?
<br>
 - As described above, using the static keyword allows for this.


## Java Singleton Class
<br>

1. What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.
<br>
- It seems this is a way to stay organized and ensure that most parts of the class etc are able to communicate as necessary. Almost like a proof the concept and doing a quick run through to ensure all pieces are connected correctly before moving forward. I think an analogy would be ensuring your engine starts and runs normally before trying to add more custom parts to get more performance out of it.

2. What is a Singleton?
<br>
 - It is a design pattern that only allows for one instance of a specific class throughout the program but can be accessed globally.
