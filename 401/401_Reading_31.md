## AWS Amplify
<br>


1. What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?
<br>
- Netlify: More front end focused and may not have the backend control desired.
- Azure: Great implementation with microsoft but learning curve may be steeper.

2. What AWS Region is closest to you?
<br>
- US EAST is the closest to me, however, I think it is mentioned that if possible you should choose the 
region closest to your users.
