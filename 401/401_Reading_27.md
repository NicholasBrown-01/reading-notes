## Android Shared Prefs, Tasks, Back Stack
<br>


1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
<br>
- This is like having a small quick access database via an API as opposed to maintaining a whole other functioning database. I guess an analogy would be getting food out of your fridge instead of going to the store every time.

2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
<br>
- Testing takes your code from theory to functional.
- Testing can bring to light bugs in the program.
- Testing can highlight more efficient way to handle data or simplify user interaction
- Testing allows us to account for scaling and see real time feasibility.

I think taking our code from isolated theory to real world functionality is the most import aspect. It's easy to get tunnel vision and create functional code in a controlled environment...but code that can withstand erroneous user input etc will be much more robust and practical....and successful.

3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
<br>
- This sounds just like a call stack in the programs we have been running. One program executes, thus cause another function to invoke. Once that function is done we return to the call stack and continue on to the next function in the call stack.
