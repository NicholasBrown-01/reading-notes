## Rule of Three
<br>

1. Are there any projects that you’ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?
<br>
- I think with all CF courses the majority of labs do a good job of ensuring you are refactoring into better and better concise and efficient code throughout the week.

2. Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?
<br>
- I think this is where constructors and methods come into play. This allows us to customize the specified variable to those constructors/methods but should updating be needed, we only target those same constructors as opposed to several different loops or individual functions etc.


## MVP
<br>

1. Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.
<br>
- Having a working proof of concept is huge. It will immediately highlight the areas that need work and allow us to clearly see what the priorities are. Without a doubt it aids in productive troubleshooting and provides the ability to make much more accurate time allocations for certain areas of the product.

2. What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.
<br>
 - Perfectionism, mis-allocation of time and resources into areas of the product that may not have needed much improvement vs areas that needed much more. Lack of motivation when there is no working model. Hard to keep investors etc when no workable progress is being shown.
