## Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
<br>
- Dual Military experience with very strong adaptive leadership styles. Having thousands of hours in an aircraft has also taught me that there isn't a lot you can't prepare for as well as the fact that staying calm, cool, and collected more often than not leads to beneficial results.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
<br>
- Typically I will take a step back and re-read instructions to verify I am not trying to make the project more complicated than it needs to be. Go back and re-watch parts of the lecture that discuss the areas in which I am stuck. Reach out to others to see what their interpretation of the assignment was.
