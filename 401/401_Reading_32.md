## Serverless, Amplify, GraphQL
<br>


1. What makes an API RESTful?
<br>
- This is a purposeful adhearence to certain requirements with the intent to ensure the client and server components can update/evolve independently of one another. There are several principals and concepts that go into this such as using layered systems, resourced based urls, and client-server separation.

2. What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?
<br>
- You can better specify data taht is needed thus reducing the amount of data you are scrubbing/manipulating. However, the learning curve is steeper and can lead to security issues when dealing with more complex queries.

3. Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.
<br>
- Instead of taking up physical space in a hardware based server and server room. Space is more efficiently allocated through cloud resources and allows for cost per execution along with not having to physically manage the server infrastructure.
