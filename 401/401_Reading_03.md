#### Reading Notes: 03

## Primitives vs. Objects
<br>

1. Explain the difference between an “int” and an “Integer” in Java.
<br>
- Int is a Primitive while Integer is an object. This means that int cannot hold a value of null as well as having not methods available to it for manipulations like Integer can. In short, int can be assigned a singular value.

2. What is the default value for ints? Integers?
<br>
- As stated above, int is set to '0', and Integer is 'null', 

3. What is autoboxing? Unboxing?
<br>
- Java will automatically convert and access value between primitives and their wrappers/objects without explicitly having to call both.

## Exceptions in Java
<br>

1. List the three basic categories of exceptions.
<br>
They are:
 - Checked Exceptions
 - Unchecked Exceptions
 - Errors

 This allows Java to catagorize and thus handle these items appropriately.  

2. What type of statement can you use to handle an exception?
<br>
- Like we did in JavaScript, you can make a catch-all with a 'try-catch' statement to handle all possible outcomes and errors.


## Using Scanner
<br>

1. Describe a situation where you think it would be useful to have a program that scans text.
<br>
- Scanners are useful any time you need user input to further the program via parameters, selection, or other needed data.

2. What is input from a Scanner broken down into?
<br>
- The input can be set based on what 'valueOf' condition is used such as 'Integer.valueOf' or 'String.valueOf'. These are also broken down into tokens which help Java understand the value to be manipulated or stored.
