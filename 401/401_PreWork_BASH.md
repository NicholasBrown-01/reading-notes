## BASH Command Line, Navigation, Pages, and File Manipulation
<br>

### Summary of Learning
<br>

By far the most significant understanding I have developed throughout this course was how much more efficient utilizing the terminal is for navigating through files.

As a normal everyday user the typical UI practice was clicking on folder after folder via window after window or right clicking etc to explore creation and other files options was the way to get things done.

However, after learning the terminal and using it on a daily basis I could not imagine going back to a graphical UI and having to manipulate a mouse to create all the directories and files necessary one by one. To me this is by far the biggest advantage of the system.

Quickly locating, accessing, creating, renaming, moving, and deleting files and folders has been a huge win for time management.
