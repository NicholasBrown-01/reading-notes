## Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia
<br>


1. Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?
<br>
- While the point of FP is to have predictable & dependable control over a data structure...you can copy and alterate the data structure to change it.

2. Define purely functional programming.
<br>
- Purely functional programming consists of ensuring that functions, inside the functional paradigm, will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any global or local state. A pure functional subroutine only has visibility of changes of state represented by state variables included in its scope.

<br>


3. How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?
<br>
- I could be off the mark but as it states FP uses call-by-name, call-by-value, and call-by-need and I feel that is what we have been doing up to this point.
