#### Java Basics
<br>

1. What does “strong typed” mean?
<br>
Everything must be compatible and specifically declared and used within the language.

2. What are the primitive data types?
<br> 
There are 8 in total: [Oracle Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
<br>

- byte: An 8-bit signed integer for saving memory in arrays and clarifying code with limited range.

- short: A 16-bit signed integer for memory-saving and limited range scenarios, similar to byte.

- int: A 32-bit signed integer with a wider range, or an unsigned 32-bit integer with a range from 0 to 2^32-1.

- long: A 64-bit signed integer for wider value ranges or an unsigned 64-bit integer from 0 to 2^64-1.

- float: A 32-bit single-precision floating-point number for efficient memory usage in large arrays, not suitable for precise values like currency.

- double: A 64-bit double-precision floating-point number, commonly used for decimal values and default choice for floating-point calculations.

- boolean: A data type with two values, true and false, used to represent simple true/false conditions.

- char: A 16-bit Unicode character with a range from '\u0000' to '\uffff' (0 to 65,535).




#### XKCD: Compiling

1. Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.
<br>
Java performs this task in a 2 step process in order to break down the whole program into the most basic instructions. JavaScript however, does it "as you go" and only when it finds repeatetive code does it break it down into more basic instructions for faster processing.

2. Does code compiling mean that it works correctly?
<br>
It does not. It means that it was able to be broken down or translated into instructions correctly. Not that those instructions are in the correct order or successful etc.


#### Reading Java Documentation

1. How many keywords does Java have?
<br>
Java has about 50-60 keywords.

2. How do you print words to the console in Java?
<br>
Primarily this is accomplished by utilizing the `System.out.println("")` method.
