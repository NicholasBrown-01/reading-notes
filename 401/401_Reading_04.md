## Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones)

1. Explain the difference between an object and a class.
<br>

2. Name two types of state that a Student object might have.
<br>
- Each Student can have a name, a grade, and age, a sex etc.

## Java Classes
<br>

1. Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.
<br>
- A constructor is used to initialize specific objects of the class it belongs to. This can be combined with the concepts of Inheritance as well to further steamline and control Classes.

2. Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).
<br>
- My attempt at doing this:
<br>

- 'public class Student {

    public int age;
    
    public Student(int Age) {
        age = enrollmentAge;
    }

    public void setAge(int newValue) {
        age = newValue;
    }
}'
