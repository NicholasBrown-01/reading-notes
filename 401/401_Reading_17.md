## O-Auth
<br>


1. In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application.
<br>
- This was a little confusing to me but in the end I think it allows for a near singular sign in and then based on tokens the app/platform you sign into can then grant temp access to other sites/apps without having to enter in your user credentials each time.

2. Which authentication providers are covered in the tutorial?
<br>
- Good and GitHub
