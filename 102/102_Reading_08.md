### Operators and Loops Loops Loops

#### There are several Expressions and Operators to choose from, but focusing on Comparison and Assignment Operators per gives us the following to choose from.

`Equal (==)`

`Not equal (!=)`

`Strict equal (===)`

`Strict not equal (!==)`

`Greater than (>)`

`Greater than (>)`

`Less than (<)`

`Less than or equal (<=)`

Main Assignments:

`=`

`+=`

`-=`

`*=`

`/=`

`%=`

`**=`

### Loops allow for a set of rules to constantly be applied while defined conditions are being met for the function.

Some examples of loops provided by `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#for_statement`

is as follows:

`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement`

  while a do while loop is as follows;

  `do
  statement
while (condition);`

Controlling these loops allows for targeting users into a specific input, or possibly controlling accesses, and in general keeping responses and inputs compatible to what the program will understand. Thus resulting in less errors and breakdowns.
