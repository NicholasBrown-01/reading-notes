### JavaScript Programming

#### Much like other languages, JS is executed with a *Top Down* priority. While going down the list, behavior is controlled via control structures such as: conditions, loops, and functions.

An example of a function would be:

`function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}`

...where we are creating the function, providing paramenters and names to be called or *invoked* at a later time.

In order for function results and/or data to be stored, a `return` must be executed and placed where the user wants the function to stop processing.

What happens in a function...stays in a function. Especially Variables.

Ex: `function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";`

  `carName` will not exist outside this function.

All these structures can be combined to create very precise decision/option making logic tunnels and trees that can guide and narrow down users to a specific decision, answer, or requested query. The possibilities are literally endless with how these methods can be utilized to make fantastic and helpful programs.
