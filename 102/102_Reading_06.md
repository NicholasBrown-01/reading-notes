#### Reading Notes: 06

### JavaScript..no not Java.

#### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are respectfully compared to the Skeleton (Structure), Skin (Appearance), and Muscles (Function) of a webpage.

<br>

Alerts, Forms, Email handling, Submissions, Interactions and Functions are all created and managed by the way in which JavaScript was implemented on the site.

And while Oracle owns both Java and JavaScript...they are each programs for different purposes and not to be used interchangeably.

JavaScript operates by way of Variables, Functions, Logic, and Operation of Order. All which can be called to create very simple input/output programs, or very complex imbedded web applications.

And just like calling a `styles.css` you can also call a `style.js` or whatever you wish to name it. But now, you can call the elements within your `style.js` at specific points in your `index.html` based on where you place them in your `index.html`. 

For example, placing a script call within your header will make that JS interaction appear/happen within your header and etc.
