### CSS is the best

##### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language/syntax that allows for our webpage/HTML products to have visually stunning and organized presentation throughout a site.

It is as simple as adding a reference...often `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` is used to accomplish this, and after creating a separate `styles.css` file you are basically up and running.

The more organized and well structured the html is, the easier it is to control the elements in css in order for a desired outcome to occur.

Clear beginning and ends to Sections, Articles, Divs, Main, etc will go a long way in customizing the site.

This also includes forming class, IDs, and names in your HTML to call on in the `styles.css` that you create. Once again making definitive start and stops when applying colors or organized order of texts and/or pictures.
