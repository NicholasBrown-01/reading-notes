# All about GIT

### GIT was developed to solve the problems of Local Version Control Systems (LVCS). It even further solved the single point of failure issue with Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)


It has since soared above and beyond its competition as the absolute *go to* when any entity needs a reliable and distributed version control system.

One of GIT's biggest highlights is the ability to make and control Repositories. This state-of-the-art directory system allows for several users to integrate and work seamlessly due to the fact that anyone can save and upload their work at virtually anytime, anywhere, and without the conflict of overrides or erasing someone else's work.

GIT also allows for changes to be easily tracked, managed, and implemented should a commit cause failure.

When used in combination with GIT Pages, it's easy to see why this toolkit is an absolute must for any company that requires constant monitoring and updates.
