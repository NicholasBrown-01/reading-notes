# The structure of HTML

### Without a doubt, HTML is the standard in which webpages are structured.

Often described as the *skeleton* of any webpage, HTML is there to provide the foundation for other common languages such as the popular visual enhancing *CSS* which can be further utilized to take basic HTML to another level of display.

HTML forces us to visualize our work pallet by often envisioning the webpage structure via wireframe or other white board techniques.

We then code out the HTML via a *Code Editor* and start to form the rough edges of the page prior to polishing it.

This takes shape via Tags, Elements, Content, Headers, Footers etc in order to give specific parameters that will later be fine tuned and customized.
