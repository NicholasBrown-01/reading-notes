# What is Markdown?

## Let's Dive in

#### Simply put, "Markdown" is a "Markup" (haha) language that allows those who are not comfortable writing content in core languages such as *HTML* or *CSS* to still be able to make it efficient and somewhat stylish. 


# GitHub Pages?

#### In combination with Markdown, these pages that are created by up to several different people... are quickly accessible to everyone at virtually the same time. This is a huge advantage as no bottle necking occurs in common workflow.

# What does this all mean?

#### With these capabilities, teams of people who are not skilled in HTML or CSS can now effectively create content while maintaining the bulk of their mental output on more import aspects of their tasks. Becoming proficient in Markdown and GitHub pages means streamlining your communication and workflow pipelines, allowing you to *knock out* task after task.
