# The Growth Mindset!

## This concept allows you to fully engage in any learning environment by training your mind to remain in a place of positivity, willingness to reach out for assistance to avoid long and unnecceary pitfalls, and to encourage the process of learning itself to be welcoming rather than threatening.

### The following are 3 Helpful Reminders:

##### 1. When feeling behind, re-focus: Breath, and know you can ask questions at the next break to catch up.
##### 2. If a task is too complicated: Think about the larger goal, but then break it down into smaller manageable steps.
##### 3. When you fail: Remember everyone does. Learn what you can from your mistake, and simply try to improve upon it.
