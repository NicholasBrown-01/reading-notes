#### Reading Notes: 01
<br>

What can be said about HTTP?
Why it's a protocol of course, that's easy to see.
A packet is sent, a packet comes back,
The Client and Server talk like this, it's a matter-of-fact.
Don't get confused about DNS,
Remember an address book, that's easier, so do not stress.
So chunks break apart, to travel quickly on highways in the sea and the sky,
Then get re-assembled in your machine, in the blink of an eye.

### Parsing
In short, parsing is the process by which HTML, CSS, and JS are read/assembled character by character or tag by tag in order to take lifeless code and display/convert it into a live environment.

### Images
Images must be free of copywrite uses. Unsplash is a popular site to gather free use images for web content/idea/placeholder creation.

### JS String vs Number
A string in JS can be assigned via using quotation `""` marks, vs  a number would be without this syntax and simply `49` for example.

### JS Variables
Variables are crucial ways to assign and store information which can be recalled later in order to solve/express/determine/parameterize functions and other formulas throughout a program.

They give us context and easily identifiable labels to assist in code writing.

#### Semantics

1. Why should you use an `h1` element over a `span` element to display a top level heading?
<br>
Proper coded HTML such as using header elements as opposed to span elements allows for search engines to understand important content on your site. This is one of the underlying values of the H1 Header.
