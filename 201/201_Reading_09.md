## HTML Forms
<br>

1. Why are forms so important in web development?
<br>
The forms of forms (haha) allow us to gather data...and data is needed to create specific, engaging, working, and dynamic products. Purchases, Contact Info, Payment information all require inputs that we get from forms.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
<br>
As with anything that requires the attention of people, make sure it is Clear and Easy to understand. Unneccesary complication will result in frustration or quitting of the audience. So use a logical layout, and try and keep it as minimul as possible.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
<br>
Text input: Creates a text field.
Checkbox: Creates a checkbox
Text Area: Creates area for long text
Submit Button: Send the data to the server to be processed
Dropdown Menu: Gather Client information or control list of choices.


## Learn JS


1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
<br>
Events are a "follow up" response that results in something occuring when an input or action is detected by the user. Like clicing "ok" on a button results in another window popping up.


2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
<br>
The name of the event and the function that will handle the event.

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
<br>
Because you can get more details on the action that triggered the event. So you can know which element was activated when sorting through multiple elements.

4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
<br>
Event bubblins is the JS default for handling events. This starts in the innermost element and then "bubbles" or works it's way out/up to the parent element. Even Capturing is the opposite where it starts at the parent and then works it way through or "down" the child elements.
