## HTML Media

### Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.
<br>

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
<br>
- If for some reason the link/img is broken it will display text in its place. More importantly, a read assist program can read the text description to visually impaired people.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
<br>
- By ensuring we are creating content that can be easily translated by screen readers, providing easy to navigate menus for those that are motor impaired and clear text for visual impaired.

3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
<br>
- Figure Elements can be used to position content without affecting the flow of the content around it. It is independent.

4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
<br>
- gif are not scalable like an svg image. If you zoom in on a gif...it will become blurry/pixalated...while an svg stays clear and easy to see.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
<br>
- I would use svg because depending on the device that is loading it, it could become distorted and blurry if someone wanted to make is bigger.

## Learn CSS

#### Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements
<br>

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
<br>
- Foreground typically applies to the font or color of the words. While background changes the "paper" it is being type/written on.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
<br>
- First thing would be to decide on a color theme/pallette consistent with the subject the webpage is handling. Ensuring sharp contrasting colors for content that needs to be shown as more important. As well as soft complimenting color for content that requires the user to be engaged for a longer period to create a feeling of comfort.

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
<br>
- Font choice is like the body language of the page. People interpret fonts differently, but overall key characteristics such as soft and rounded fonts vs. hard and sharp will contribute to the feel of your page/content.

4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?
<br>
- Physical size of the font
- Bold-ness of the font
- Font property (Normal, italic, oblique)

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.
<br>
- Utilizing the `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` properties allows you to customize space between H1 Words or individual Letters.
