#### Reading Notes: 14 Psychological Safety
<br>

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
<br>


1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
<br>
I didn't find specifically a direct reference, however, overall I believe it is close to these 3 things: Trust, Fair or Equal Communication, Mutual Respect. These factors combine to allow members to feel "safe" to share and communicate with others without fear of reprisal.
<br>

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
<br>
Overall, in the Military world, most egos act to that of being stuck in the senior year of highschool. In other words even leaders themselves put their performance and their visual public appearance above others....so pretty toxic. However, what I loved about the world of Aviation, even in the military, is that when lives are on constantly on the line, it cuts through all of that.

Prior to every single flight, as a part of our "crew-briefing", we always acknowledge that no matter what is happening, if someone feels unsafe or needs to communication information, we WILL all listen to their concern without fear of reprisal. This has saved countless lives as often (in terms of near collisions, mishaps etc) it was an inexperienced crew member that challenged a decision or brought something up to the attention of the crew.
<br>

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
<br>
Feeling "safe" to share and discuss option or opinions amongst the group ensures that problem soloving is open to several solutions instead of only a few or possibly even one if lead by a dictator-like leader. By allowing others to equally share in communication and be heard, the group can openly compare and contrast ideas and collectively work towards the goal in the most efficient way possible. This also allows each member to "buy-in" to the tasks and have a sense of purpose and "role" in moving foward when they felt heard.
