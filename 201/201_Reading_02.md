### HTML Text Fundamentals & HTML Advanced Text Formatting
<br>

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
<br>
- Semantics allow for not only the user, but the computer to understand general information about the data being written and what to do with it. It makes data/text easier to identify and more clearly understand what to do with the information.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
<br>
- There are a total of 6 Heading Elements. 

3. What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?
<br>
- As far as superscript vs subscript, they can be useful for proper formatting of numbers, dates, formulas etc.

4. When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
<br>
- Abbreviation tags must have the title content within the tag.

### Learn CSS
<br>

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
<br>
- We can call the external file via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` or via inline CSS Code such as: `<h4 style="color:white;">This is a heading</h4>`

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
<br>
- They are more specific, thus if an external CSS is later added it can cause issues. It is also harder to visually organize what areas of the html are being affected and/or customized.

<br>
