## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
<br>
Domain Modeling gives everyone at the table a common operating picture in which to work from. It breaks down the issue into specific relationships, classes, objects, attributes etc that can be quantified, rated, customized, and called upon throughout the program to deliver a desired result.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
<br>
Tables are not there to be utilized in helping with HTML Page Structure. They are there to represent tabular data.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.
<br>

- `<thead>` is the header content.
- `<tr>` is a row.
- `<caption>` is a title or description


## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
<br>
This is a method in object-oriented code. They are used declare object properties and allow for consistency and flexibility throughout the program.

2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
<br>
`this` when declared inside a function is a reference to the object the function creates. `This` inside a constructor means something is being created with a new value.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor


1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience. 

NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
<br>

When working on a helicopter, many are created with the same basic stucture and components...like a prototype. However, based on the mission set for that day, some of those components can be changed to better facilitate the mission, but all other body, equipment etc remains the same.
