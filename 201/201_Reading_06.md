## JavaScript Object Basics
<br>

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
<br>
An object is a way to assign several items/details/specifics all under one title or name. Such as saying the word "Human". Well, all humans have "arms, legs, head, neck etc". So you can assign all those body parts under the "object" of "human" and the system will know to include all those parts by just calling the one name "human".

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
<br>
That they can later be applied with constructors. 

3. How do objects differ from arrays?
<br>
Array only carry a "list" of things/data in one variable, while objects are assigned multiple "characteristics" and data types of information.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
<br>
If the property name has spaces or special characters in it, bracket notation is required.

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?
<br>
`this` refers to the const `dog`. The advantage of `this` is that we can reuse functions that have the ability to be used with different objects. 

## Introduction To The DOM
<br>

1. What is the DOM?
<br>
The Document Object Model is what allows elements/data in a webpage (in our case) to be more than a "static" product. By utilizing objects, methods, functions etc, content can be manipulated and thus be interactive to the user.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
<br>

Javascript is simply the language used to manipulate/control the data representation of the webpage managed by the DOM.
