## Video and Audio Content
<br>

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
<br>

The early 2000s had Adobe Flash which allowed for emebeded videos. This was quickly overtaken vy HTML 5 as it provided native support for video and audio on webpages.


2. Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element.
<br>

The `src` has the same application as sourcing an image tag while the `control` attribute involved the interface with controling the video itself such as a "start" and "stop".


3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?
<br>

Just like an img needs alt text, a video needs fallback content in order to display or read to users in the event the video does not work properly.

4. Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.
<br>

There were 2 friends audio and video. Audio could talk but not convey this thoughts through video. And video could visualize thoughts but not communicate audibly. Thus, they rely on eachother to accomplish both.
