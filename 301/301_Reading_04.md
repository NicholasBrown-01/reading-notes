## React Docs and Forms

### Creating Hyperlinks

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
<br>
- Controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component's state. 

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
<br>
- I guess it depends on what information is being gathered by the form. But overall, I would think as soon as they enter the information. This is because we won't lose information if the leave the page, or if they need immediate feedback (such as correcting the information they are providing).

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
<br>
 - You can use the event object that is in the event handler by assigning the users input to a variable that you can call or log.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
<br>

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
<br>
- It is a shorthand way of writing if/else statements which can actually be more readable and clear as long as we are dealing with "true" and "false" type statments. Or one result, if not that one, than another.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
<br>
- 'console.log (x===y ? true : false);'
