## Functional Programming Concepts
<br>

1. What is functional programming?
<br>
- This is "is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data".

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
<br>
- This is a function that "returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic) and it does not cause any observable side effects."

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
<br>
- They are easier to test, as well as being more "composable" and therefore less error prone.

4. What is immutability?
<br>
- This involves the property of an object or data structure. They are those objects with states that cannot changes once instantiated.

5. What is Referential transparency?
<br>
- This is a property of a function that will always produce the same result for a given input.

1. What is a module?
<br>
- It is a self contained unit of code that can be reused in other parts of the program.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
<br>
- This indicates a module or package that is mandatory for the program to run correctly.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
<br>
- You can use an 'import' or include statement such as 'const moduleName = require('module-name');'

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
<br>
- The module must be exported and then called or installed before being imported into another program.
