## Learn CSS - Flexbox
<br>

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
<br>
Flexbox is for single surface products. It can account for and calculate spacial needs based on single dimensions such as x and y axis... but not for depth (a z-axis).

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
<br>
As states above, x and y axis are interchangeable with the concept of the Main Axis (left to right) and Cross Axis (top to bottom). The key difference being that Main Axis always flows from the left to the right, and Cross Axis always flows from the top to the bottom...unless stated otherwise via CSS or inline styles.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
<br>
Flexbox is purely for visual organizing purposes. Utilizing certain features will cause content to possibily appear in incorrect orders of logic sense, such as a menu or article list. Screen readers or tab navigation may not be able to relay the content correctly.

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
<br>
One of the largest benefits of Flexbox is it's ability to dynamically align content across differenet platforms (Computers, Ipads, Phones etc.). Is also does so with less CSS coding than float.

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
<br>
I think as a professional developer a high priority is for your product to alway be visually consistent across devices. Understanding flexbox is key to doing so. Especially for the purpose of not discourage interaction or engagament from your audience to complicated content that is not orgranized in a desireable way.
