## NoSql vs Sql
Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL   | NoSQL  |
|-------|--------|
| SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data, and are typically table-based. | NoSQL databases are non-relational and do not use SQL. They can be document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or other types. |
| SQL databases are good for complex queries and transactions, such as those used in online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. | NoSQL databases are designed for scalability and performance, making them ideal for big data and real-time web applications. |
| SQL databases are usually vertically scalable, meaning they require expensive hardware upgrades to increase capacity. | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can be scaled out across multiple servers to handle increased traffic and data volume. |
| SQL databases enforce ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties, which guarantee data integrity and consistency. | NoSQL databases typically prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency, and may not enforce ACID properties. |
| SQL databases are widely used in enterprise applications, such as banking and finance, where data consistency and reliability are critical. | NoSQL databases are often used in web and mobile applications, social media, and IoT, where speed and flexibility are more important than data consistency. |

*Table Made with ChatGPT*

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
<br>
- Structured Data that is well defined.

2. Give a real world example.
<br>
- Financial Data and Inventory Management

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
<br>
- Unstructured without a fixed scheme.

4. Give a real world example.
<br>
- Social Media like Instagram with requires scalable and flexible data like photos.

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
<br>
- NoSql. Used for things like organization charts or file systems.

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
<br>
- NoSql becuase they can be scaled horizontally across multiple servers. SQL is more vertically flexible requiring more processing power on a single server concept.

## Sql vs NoSql

1. What does SQL stand for?
<br>
- Structured Query Language.

2. What is a relational database?
<br>
- Type of database the organized data into one or more tables.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
<br>
- Table-based structure data.

4. What is a ‘schema’?
<br>
- It is a blueprint that defines the structure of the database.

5. What is a NoSQL database?
<br>
- It uses a variety of data models like key-model or document or graph based.

6. How does it work?
<br>
- Something like Mongo DB stores data in documents kind of like JSON objects.

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
<br>
- Collections, like tables in SQL Databases. Each collection has a set of documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
<br>
- Mongo DB because it does not require a predefined schema.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- It sacrafices consistency for scalability. It also has "less tools" compared to SQL.
